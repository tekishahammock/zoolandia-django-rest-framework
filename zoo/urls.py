# Django REST framework uses conventions heavily. Consider the two
# ways of defining the routes below. This first, uncommented block
# is very concise, but also makes many assumptions.
#
# The DefaultRouter will bind the route you specify (e.g. 'animals')
# with a ViewSet but also automagically creates a default / route that
# will list all of the resources you specify.
# {
#   "animals": "http://localhost:8000/animals/",
#   "habitats": "http://localhost:8000/habitats/",
#   "employees": "http://localhost:8000/employees/"
# }
#
# It uses convention to define the detail view as well, which had
# to be manually built using basic routing at the bottom. Notice that it is
# not specified how to handle the route /animals/2. The framework figures
# that out through convention.
